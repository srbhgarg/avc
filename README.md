# avc
Speech Communications

This code was tested on mp4 files. In case of issues reading video files, check the codecs or use different function. 
"mmread" function was also found to be useful to read the audio/video data

There is some issue in reading video files using MATLAB's videoReader function on MAC OS. I have not tested on other platforms
to confirm if the issue is still there on other platforms.

avc_main.m is the main function file to run the code.

data folder contain some sample data to run the code.
